I am Joy Olajumoke Adejumo, a passionate and results-driven Project Manager and Scrum Master with extensive experience leading cross-functional teams across diverse industries, including technology, legal, and healthcare. My background in law, coupled with my project management expertise, enables me to approach challenges with a strategic and analytical mindset.

Throughout my career, I have successfully managed a variety of projects, from developing complex software solutions to streamlining legal processes and improving healthcare systems. I am adept at facilitating agile ceremonies, such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives, ensuring effective communication and collaboration within teams.

My commitment to process improvement, risk management, and stakeholder engagement has consistently driven projects to successful completionâ€”on time, within scope, and with exceptional client satisfaction. I am proficient in leveraging tools like JIRA, TRELLO, ASANA and MS Project to optimize project tracking, resource management, and continuous improvement.

I am dedicated to delivering exceptional value, coaching teams in Agile practices, and aligning project goals with broader business objectives, no matter the industry or project complexity.
