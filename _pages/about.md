I am Joy Olajumoke Adejumo, a passionate and results-driven Project Manager and Scrum Master with extensive experience leading cross-functional teams across diverse industries, including technology, legal, and healthcare. My background in law, coupled with my project management expertise, enables me to approach challenges with a strategic and analytical mindset.

Throughout my career, I have successfully managed a variety of projects, from developing complex software solutions to streamlining legal processes and improving healthcare systems. I am adept at facilitating agile ceremonies, such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives, ensuring effective communication and collaboration within teams.

My commitment to process improvement, risk management, and stakeholder engagement has consistently driven projects to successful completion—on time, within scope, and with exceptional client satisfaction. I am proficient in leveraging tools like JIRA, TRELLO, ASANA and MS Project to optimize project tracking, resource management, and continuous improvement.

I am dedicated to delivering exceptional value, coaching teams in Agile practices, and aligning project goals with broader business objectives, no matter the industry or project complexity.
